<td>   The characters of<b><u>  F ScotFitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby </u></b> represent a specific segment of <b>1920s</b> American society: the rich hedonists of the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald’s own experiences during this era form the basis of the novel. In fact, several characters are based on people Fitzgerald encountered, from a famous bootlegger to his own ex-girlfriend. <i>Ultimately, the novel's characters paint a complex portrait of an amoral American society, drunk on its own prosperity.</i>

<td> Odysseys  </td>
<td>Homer   </td>
<td> Bernard  Knox publications </td>
<td>If the Iliad is the world's greatest war epic, then the<b> Odyssey </b> is <i>literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey though life</i> Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to <b>Ithaca </b>after the <b>Trojan War</b>, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance.
<p>
In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of <u>Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.</u>
<i>This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.</i>
