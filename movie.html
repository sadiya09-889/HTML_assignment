Chopra expressed his desire to make a comeback to the film industry after a gap of seven years, as he was unsatisfied with the scripts he had been offered. It was during this time that Aditya narrated a few scenes from a story he had written, which intrigued Chopra and sparked his interest to direct it. Chopra envisioned the film as a tribute to Punjab, aiming to capture the essence of the region. It was to be titled Yeh Kahaan Aa Gaye Hum, based on an eponymous song from Yash Chopra's Silsila (1981). Set in India and Pakistan, principal photography took place in Punjab and various locations in Mumbai; parts of the film were also shot in Pakistan. The soundtrack album, based on old compositions by Madan Mohan with lyrics by Javed Akhtar, was the highest-selling album of the year in India.</p>
